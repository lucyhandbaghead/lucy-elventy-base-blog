# About Lucy Handbaghead

Lucy Handbaghead is a woman with a handbag for a head.

She lives in The Pretty Big Handbag.

And they live (kind of happily) in The Pretty Big Handbag.

You'll find stories about Lucy, her mum and a bunch of other people with bags and odd objects for heads on this little website.

I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing them.

Cheers!

Duncan
