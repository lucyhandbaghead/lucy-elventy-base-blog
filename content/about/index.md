# About Lucy Handbaghead

Lucy Handbaghead is a woman with a handbag for a head.

She lives (kind of happily) with her mum Linda in The Pretty Big Handbag.

The Pretty Big Handbag is pretty much what it sounds like - a massive handbag hurtling through space.

On this little website you'll find stories about Lucy, her mum and all the other jolly (and not so jolly) people who live in The Pretty Big Handbag.

I hope you enjoy reading them as much as I enjoy writing them.

Cheers!

Duncan
