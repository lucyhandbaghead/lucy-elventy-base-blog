## Part 1

Once upon a time in The Pretty Big Handbag...

Lucy Handbaghead was at the zoo.

Linda - her mum - was there too.

And they were watching a monkey do a poo.

I'm not sure what kind of worlds you're familiar with, but monkeys - and animals in general - in The Pretty Big Handbag are maybe a little bit different to what you're used to...

You see, they don't have bags for heads...

Or odd-objects for heads...

Or even 'animal' heads, like you might find elsewhere out there amongst the stars (or down the back of the cosmic sofa)...

Instead, they all have fleshy human heads.

Like no fur, except sometimes a bit on top...

And they're capable of all kinds of horrific expressions, like smiling, frowning, and - in the case of the monkey in question - straining really hard.

It was all a bit weird to be honest.

Especially if you were used to being able to keep your purse in your head, like Lucy and Linda.

Lucky for those two beauts though - as in Lucy and Linda - they were completely oblivious to the potential for monkeys - and other animals - to have different kinds of heads... 

And were just busy happily watching the human-headed, furry-bodied monkey squeeze out a big fat curly one.

Well, they were anyway until their attention was yanked elsewhere by a sentence that parachuted in on the wind like a bad-smelling monkey-poo...

"And that is why women - especially handbag headed women - will always be inferior to the more powerful of our species... the man, especially those wearing the illustrious pitta-bread hat."

A round of bad-smelling applause followed, sky-diving in on the next puff of wind.

Lucy and Linda looked at each other.

A look that said one thing...

And that thing was, 'We'll bloody see about that'.

They turned their back on the pooping monkey - much to his dismay because he was rather enjoying their attention - and marched off in the direction the words had come from...

Which was off that way, up there...

Yes, behind those bins...

## Part 2

The human-headed hamster enclosure had never been so packed...

And not with human-headed hamsters - although there were a few of them doing yoga and eating ham sandwiches...

But with absolute dweebs.

It was a serious sea of unwashed pants...

Involuntarily ejaculation...

And the inability to talk to anyone with a pair of boobs that wasn't their mum or a poster of their mum.

Oh, and they were all wearing pitta bread hats on their unanimously greasy heads...

Which basically just means they have pitta breads on their heads.

The crowd was, of course, all men...

And on a scale of Alpha to Beta and all the way down to Omega - AKA the The Alphabet Of Bicep-Pumping Testosterone - they had all fallen off the end and were scrabbling around to create a new even-manlier alphabet...

One where women - and anyone else who didn't identify as a big manly man - weren't invited.

At the front of the room - standing on a hamster cage and gesturing with his hands like he was parting a great red sea, but in fact was parting a great sweaty sea - was a very thin man with a real pitta bread for a head...

And he was mid speech - declaration even - saying...

"Nature has spoken. The natural order is fixed. It's not sexist - nor political - to say that men have found themselves at the apex, the crux, the summit of bag and other odd object head kind... we are the rugged shepherds - the brave human-headed dog walkers - of all who inhabit The Pretty Big Handbag, tasked with guiding our great civilisation to ever greater, ever more productive, ever more manly heights... and making sure womankind - and Them Lot Who Shan't Be Named - don't get too emotional and bring all we have worked so hard - and grown immaculate beards - for tumbling down."

The dweeb sea erupted into clammy applause and undiluted sweat that tasted of insecurity and 24-hour non-stop video game marathons sprayed everywhere.

I know it tasted like that for sure because a bit landed in my mouth.

Anyway, Lucy and Linda had been standing at the back of the hamster enclosure listening to all of this dressed-up diatribe...

And they could no longer keep quiet...

# Part 3

"Oi pitta bread head, what the hell are you on about?" shouted Lucy.

The sea of dweebs gasped.

Two women - and the worst kind at that, filthy, filthy handbag heads - had come within touching distance of their big fat wobbly man boobs.

And they - as in the sea of dweebs - were all instantly erect.

But - despite all their blood rapidly rushing out of their arms and towards their not-so-ample nether regions - most of them still managed to whip out their phones.

After all, this could be another viral moment...

A clip of their pitta-headed overlord owning some more 'boobed noobs' with his ferocious intellect and masterfully angular eyebrows...

And any one of these dweebs - yes even Nathan Neckbeard over there, four rows from the front, who had a bearded neck for a head - could be the lucky pitta bread hat wearer who uploaded the clip to BagTube or BagTok or Instabag and got all the views.

The pitta bread headed man focused all of his watery-eyed attention on Lucy and Linda...

Put his fingers together in an arched temple - presumably an act of prayer or - more than likely - self worship...

And then launched this intellectual - or at least intelligible - attack on the two handbag-headed women...

"My name is Jordan Pittabreadhead," he bellowed in a voice doing its best to sound post-pubescent, "and I have been sent here on a very important mission to fix The Crisis In Tiny Willies."

There was a slightly muted applause from the crowd - minus Lucy and Linda and the hamsters - as legs were crossed and heads were shook in a 'he's not talking about me and my big dong' gesture.

"You've been sent to this zoo to do what now?" asked Linda raising an eyebrow and partaking in a bit of yoga with the hamsters.

"It sounds like you're having a crisis in something alright," said Lucy, tucking into a sandwich handed to her by one of the hamsters...

Who admirably seemed to be doing their best just to ignore what was going on in their enclosure.

"A crisis in self esteem, self awareness and the ability to do push ups by the look of it!" said Linda, bending over into a Sideways Penguin pose.

"There you go!" erupted Jordan Pittabreadhead, spitting angry cucumber and guacamole bits over the crowd.

"These women are EMOTIONAL! They're letting their emotions override their logical brain bits... in fact, research suggests - no ORDERS - that handbag heads like these two have no logical brain bits whatsoever! So, no wonder they're overflowing with dribbling, mindless, blinding, sexy - no, dammit, not sexy - very-not-sexy, self-deluding EMOTION!"

The crowd turned their phones - all lit with little red recording light glows - from their super-manly master to Lucy and Linda...

And proceeded to recorded events that what would later be used as evidence in various police stations, (what counts for legal in The Pretty Big Handbag) courts...

Broadcast across major news channels - like Fuck You News and The Pretty Big Handbag Broadcasting Company...

And even make an appearance in The Bathroom Of Final Judgement in The Big Yo's Mighty Decision Making Mansion...

## Part 4

"I feel like we should belt him one for that Mum," said Lucy, "but I can't really be... bothered."

"I mean, I'm actually not all that bothered either," said Linda, "he seems to be doing a good enough job of making a tit out of himself without our help."

Some nearby dweeb erections throbbed sinfully at the mention of 'tit'.

"Yer, if he carries on like that he's going to overcook his own pitta bread head," said Lucy.

So - perhaps for the first time in a Lucy Handbaghead story - a fight seemed like it *wasn't* going to break out.

But then... what the hell would this story be about?

So, that's when - as if by plot progression magic - a bloke with a very shiny potato for a head kicked his way through the wall of the human-headed hamster enclosure...

Which was made out of straw and shedded hamster fur, so it wasn't all that an impressive feat after all.

But that didn't stop him from flexing his potato pecks and baked-potato biceps - in fact, all his mash-potato muscles - in a self-congratulatory display of unrivalled strength.

Unrivalled by at least three of the human-headed hamsters, anyway...

And those being the three hamsters who'd swapped all their muscles for jelly beans at the Muscly Jelly Bean Market down the road from the zoo.

Anyway, this potato-headed man was wearing a jacket made out of foreskins and sunglasses engraved with the phrase 'Bad Ass Potato Man', had a martial arts belt tied around his potato head, and was carrying a bunch of potatoey pamphlets in his potato palms...

Which he immediately - yes, right now - began to chuck out into the sea of dweebs, who snapped them up with the eagerness of The Big Yo's most worshippy worshippers paying off his bar tabs.

That's because the dweebs all knew who this potato head was...

Which was evidenced by them screaming stuff like...

"Look, it's Andrew Potatohead!"

"Check out his washboard mash potato abs!"

"I heard his semen is so potent he impregnated The Pretty Big Handbag itself!"

Yes, it was Andrew Potatohead, the very-manly (and potatoey) online - as in on the Bagnet /Interbag - phenomenon who'd amassed a huge following on Argue About Anything media platforms, like Twatter.

He was the face of the Smelly Blokes movement...

A last line of defence for persecuted manly - and not so manly, although don't tell them that - men who believed that blokes (any willy size) should be allowed to parade around unwashed and stinking, even in an age when The Pretty Big Handbag had developed new and improved - and more inclusive - ways of living...

Like washing with soap.

And, boy, was this unwashed potato head doing his best to represent this nasally toxic cause!

A few of the dweebs closest to him feinted, either to confirm what I'm saying... or because all their blood had rushed from their heads, out of their nether regions and gone off somewhere hot on holiday.

Andrew Potatohead was also one of the designer-stubbled faces of - and big time potato donar to - The Crisis In Tiny Willies for one very small reason that will remain firmly in his pants.

Well, firmly if he can find someone to shout at, otherwise it stays a bit soft.

Anyway, Andrew Potatohead had something to say...

And because this part of the story is getting a bit long, we might as well here him say it in the next part...

## Part 5

Andrew Potatohead straddled his buddy Jordan Pittabreadhead's shoulders - the aforementioned small reason not hindering him in doing so...

And - as his mash-potato mouth moved into a spud-based smile - he began to read from his potato pamphlet...

"You dweebs - who have yet to level up into real manly potato men like me, the awesome Andrew Potatohead - are invited to attend... The University Of Hard Cocks," he took a baked-potato breath and then continued, "where - for the price of everything you own and two fancy sports cars - I will teach you how to be real businessy potato men."

There was a round of hysterical, screaming applause as - presumably - wombs started wandering the bodies of various members of the sea of dweebs and they threw their nickers at Andrew's potato face.

Then Andrew Potatohead turned his potatoey eye pockets and baked-potato breath on Lucy and Linda...

"No women allowed," he screeched in a very manly, er, screech, "because that would be gay. And The University of Hard Cocks is anything but gay."

For the second time in this story, Lucy and Linda looked at each other with an expression that said, 'We'll bloody see about that'.

Their joint expression was also tinged with more than a hint of, 'The University Of Hard Cocks does sound a bit gay, doesn't it?'.

So, when Andrew Potatohead and Jordan Pittabreadhead, followed by the sea of dweebs, began to march out of the human-headed hamster enclosure...

The two handbag-headed women followed...

Thus ending this rather short part of the story, which - thinking about it - probably could of just been part of the last part...

But, oh well...

## Part 6

"Welcome to The School Of Hard Cocks," said Andrew Potatohead.

They - as in him, Jordan Pittabreadhead and the sea of dweebs - were all sitting in Andrew's bachelor potato pad, with their legs spread wide apart to demonstrate to the world - or at least each other - that they all had sizeable reasons to accommodate...

Even if that size was on the small side.

Lucy and Linda - two women, I must remind you - were going unseen and unnoticed in the crowd...

Which it has to be said was a rare occurrence for them both, especially Linda.

But their anonymity in the sea of dweebs was thanks to them wearing impenetrable disguises that completely transformed them from one gender into another, via a brief holiday in between...

In other words they'd both popped fake moustaches on their beautiful handbag heads - which complemented Linda's usual layer of stubble - and Linda kept farting a lot...

Which, admittedly, was less to do with her disguise and more to do with the big ham sandwich she'd eaten on the way here.

Anyway, back to the important, or at least plot progressing, stuff...

Andrew Potatohead's small reason, tucked away in his skin-tight leather pants, was rock hard.

If said rock was made out of jelly...

And the jelly had been left in the sun to melt for a week or two.

Anyway - again, trying to get back to the so-called important stuff - Andrew was laying down some laws, presumably to penetrate them later...

"There are eight rules at The University Of Hard Cocks..." he said, sticking up eight of his finger fries for those in the audience who were hard of counting, which was quite a few.

"Rule number one, you do not talk about The University Of Hard Cocks (because I called it something a bit embarrassing and it's too late to change the paper work)... rule number two, you DO NOT talk about The University Of Hard Cocks (because I called it something a bit embarrassing and it's too late to change the paper work)... rule number three, if someone yells 'stop!', goes limp in your hands, or taps your bum, then that's proper gay and - although there's nothing wrong with being gay, except it's a bit womanly - we're manly men, so you will be spanked by another manly man, maybe with their rock hard cock... or a frisbee."

He took in a deep baked-potato breath and then continued...

"Rule number four, actually... I've forgotten all the other rules. But, basically, they're something like everyone has to be naked and we all have to fight each other... because both of those things are extremely arousing... sorry, I mean manly! Extremely manly, dammit!"

The sea of dweebs looked at each other, waves of insecurity rippling across its surface and washing up on a beach absent of self confidence, but with quite a few starfish.

Jordan Pittabreadhead, on the other hand, was already bum naked, his skeletal frame and skeletal reason - as in his willy - on display for all to see...

Provided all had a very strong microscope (maybe one designed for looking at human-headed ant reasons - as in willies) to get a good look at the latter.

Andrew Potatohead stood up.

He tore off his leather shirt...

Leather trousers...

Leather pants...

And threw the pair of rolled up leather socks that had been in those pants over his shoulder...

To reveal that he too was keeping the very strong microscope industry in business.

"Right, you lot of big not-gay bummers, get naked!" he shouted.

And - not wanting to be accused of being unmanly - the sea of dweebs did as obeyed and turned into...

The sea of bum naked dweebs.

"Alright, now we cuddle... bugger, sorry! I mean fight. Now, we fight!" shouted Andrew.

And he dove into the naked - and increasingly erect - crowd...

## Part 7

It was a good old fashioned punch up.

Actually, it wasn't.

It was a good old fashioned pile of naked men cuddling the crap out of each other...

And then suddenly getting alarmed about what they were doing and limply punching each other in feigned disgust...

Which would eventually - actually, rather quickly - result in another round of cuddling and kissing and a bit of fiddling...

And which all climaxed in... well, actually, something unexpected (but, of course, with the expected amount of semen, which was quite a lot)...

As I'm about to relate.

You see, what the sea of naked bum dweebs - or whatever we're calling them - didn't realise was they had two very adept fighters in their midst...

One, specifically, who had a black belt in kicking the crap out of pub landlords, other-worldly beings and anyone who looked at her - or her daughter - funny.

"This is so gay," said Lucy matter-of-factly.

"It is very gay, isn't it?" agreed Linda, her moustache falling halfway off her face so she looked like an undercover spy who's identity was about to be revealed...

Which is pretty much what was about to happen.

For the bumpteenth time - which is one after umpteenth - one of the sea of bum naked dweebs tried to grab Linda...

And for the bumpteenth time she smacked them in their bum fluff covered face...

Which, just for the record, happened to be plastered on a portable video game case head.

Not to suggest that all portable video game case heads were door-licking dweebs...

But this one was pretty damn door-licky and dweeby.

Anyway, Linda's actions had drawn some unwanted attention...

"You lads aren't fighting the right way," shouted Andrew Potatohead - he was wrapped around Jordan Pittabreadhead in the Marmalade On Toast yoga position - "you've got to let us cuddle you... not in a gay way, just in like a powerful entrepreneurial way. How else will you learn to be all businessy?"

"I don't want to be cuddled by any of these dweebs," said Lucy.

"And I don't want to be cuddled at all," said Linda, who - apart from Lucy - didn't let anyone without industrial-grade sandpaper stubble or special bag powers cuddle her, naked or otherwise...

In fact, some people said she'd nailed The Grim Bagger and The Big Yo on the same night.

But some people also said The Pretty Big Handbag was actually a flat-pack wardrobe, so we probably shouldn't listen to some people.

"You will do as I say!" shouted Andrew Potatohead, unwrapping himself from a sweating and tantrically exhausted Jordan Pittabreadhead.

Once upnwrapped - and, if you look really closely, still erect - he started to mash-potato march towards them.

And for the third time in this story, Lucy and Linda looked at each other with an ever more familiar expression...

It said, 'We'll bloody see about that'.

And they rolled up their sleeves and marched towards the potato headed man strutting towards them...

## Part 8

This time it really was a good old fashioned punch up...

And a quick one at that!

In fact, Linda dropped Andrew Potatohead in one  punch...

Her big potato-masher of a fist mashing his potato head and potato brain into... well, mash potato.

That doesn't mean she killed him...

Just laid him out for a few mash-potato minutes as his head re-starched back together.

Meanwhile, in a series of spectacular one-hit wonders, Lucy and Linda proceeded to knock out every moist particle making up the sea of bum naked dweebs...

Smashing it into the sea of bum naked, bruised and snivelling dweebs.

Jordan Pittabreadhead was the only one left standing, cowering in a corner like a scared... well, man with a pitta bread for a head.

By now - and outing this narrator's descriptive skills to be not very good - Lucy and Linda's impenetrable disguises had been penetrated...

In other words, their moustaches had fallen off and Linda had stopped farting, revealing that they were in fact, yes...

Two handbag-headed women.

Two handbag-headed women who'd just kicked the potato and dweeb out of a bunch of self-declared manly men.

It was right about now that Andrew Potatohead regained consciousness to witness this fact and - presumably unable to compute what he was seeing - his reconstituted potato head...

Exploded in a shower of baked-potato brain!

"Looks like The Grim Bagger will be having baked beans on exploded potato head tonight!" said someone...

Oh wait, it wasn't someone, it was me - the speaker of this potatoey story...

And I'll keep saying more stuff, but in the next part...

## Part 9

Jordan Pittabreadhead wasn't cowering in the corner anymore...

He was shaking with rage in the middle of the now ownerless bachelor potato pad.

A rage that was as fierce as it was flaccid...

And as scary as it was laughable...

And considering all the human-headed hamsters - who'd followed everyone here from their enclosure - were rolling about on the floor in belly-busting stitches, it was both pretty scary and pretty laughable.

Jordan Pittabreadhead brought his shaking fingers together in the most pointy temple shape you have probably ever seen...

It was pointier than the The Shart in the big smelly city of Londonbag...

Pointier than Le Human-Headed Hippo Tower in the lengthy bread loving city of Bagris / Paribag...

And definitely pointier than The Pink House in the city of Not-Washed-In-A-While DC (District of Cucumbers) in Ameribag / Bagmerica.

In other words, it was pretty pointy.

Then, once his fingers were so arched they looked like they were going to snap, he unleashed this long-winded, biologically hyper-focused, cherry-picked and - let's be honest - quite embarrassing tirade.

Brace yourself - if just to be bored for the duration of it...

"No, no, NO! This cannot be! You two handbag-headed women cannot defy evolution in this way. You are the LESSER half of our species. In fact, if you do the manly maths - which us men invented by the way - and include all human-headed male animals you're only one quarter of our species while us brainy men are three quarters of it! Basically all of it!"

He took a wheezy pitta-bread breath and then carried on...

"You are ruled by EMOTION! And all that other stuff I said earlier. You cannot think straight, let alone do tax returns on your own. You need us. You need ME! Big manly Jordan Pittabreadhead. Plus this... you bring every bad thing that has ever happened to you and your rampantly seductive kind on yourself. You are the despicable testosterone temptresses of noble men like me and the mashed-up mashed-potato pile that is now Andrew Potatohead. You dress like Barbag Dolls and thrust your boobies - YOUR BIG FAT BOOBIES - in our faces and then complain when we bury our heads in your sinful cleavages uninvited! You slap yourself up in makeup and then complain when us big brave manly men show you a tiny bit of interest by chasing you down the street and trying to pinch your big fat VICE-FILLED bums..."

He took another breath, even though the bright-red colour of his pitta-bread head suggested these breaths weren't doing much to oxygenate or calm him...

"You ask for it you filthy slaggers! You belong in the kitchen! You belong in a sandwich for us men to eat whenever we're hungry! You belong in a bin bag with the rest of the rubbish! And now - NOW - you have the sexy cheek to take our manly jobs! In fact, the manliest job of all: punching stuff in the face. And you - especially you Linda Handbaghead - think you can beat up anyone in The Pretty Big Handbag and... and... and... and..." Jordan Pittabreadhead came out of his blood-level rising, eye-ball popping rage for a moment and looked at the pile of unconscious dweebs around him,"you can? You can beat up pretty much anyone in The Pretty Big Handbag? What is this? Who am I? What am I? Where's my MUMMY? MUMMY!"

And then, using all of his pious academic learning, he added...

"AAAAHHHH!!! OOOHH OOOHH, AHHH AHHH! OOOHHH! AAAAAHHHH!"

Lucy and Linda looked at each other...

A different expression mirrored on their beautiful handbag-head faces this time.

"Bloody hell, he's gone 'full evolution'," said Lucy to her Mum, "you never want to go full evolution..."

And, as if on queue, Jordan Pittabreadhead began to transform...

## Part 10

I'm not sure if you've ever seen a man with a pitta bread for a head turn into a monkey with a human head...

But it's actually a pretty quick and painless process.

Not really!

Going 'full evolution' as it was known in gardening Bagbook / Facebag groups was actually extremely painful.

And it always invoked Mother Nature herself.

You know, just to oversee what was happening because a manager could never really trust her staff not to be doing yoga or rolling around on the floor laughing when they should be working.

Which, in this case, was exactly what her staff - the human-headed hamsters - were doing...

Most of them were rolling around in hysterics on the floor, while a few practiced their Confused Melon yoga positions.

So - having taken root in the middle of the bachelor potato pad - there Mother Nature was in all her green glory...

With her giant 300 year-old tree height, bodacious buxom body all covered in leafs - except for her big fat bra-less fleshy boobs from which the rivers of all The Pretty Big Handbag constantly ran...

And - just like all the animals in her kingdom - with her human-headed face.

She had big green eyes...

Green make up on her plump cheeks...

And big green lips, out of which stuck a twisting twig she was chewing on.

She was standing over Jordan Pittabreadhead - or what moments before had been Jordan Pittabreadhead - watching him rapidly get furrier all over his body and fleshier around his face...

And she had these profound words to say in her booming voice, which sounded like flowers and thunderstorms rolled into one...

"You've made a religion... a cult out of evolution you little bell end. And now you've got to stop."

She gave him a little kick in his now monkey bum, then said...

"Maybe me and The Big Yo shouldn't have given you lot such tiny willies, but it was kind of funny at the time. And we've got to get our kicks somewhere."

"Don't bring me into this you leafy beaut," shouted a voice from up high.

Mother Nature ignored him - for it was definitely the voice of a male yo-yo headed deity, and a drunk one at that - and said this to the ball of fur and face of flesh curled up on the floor...

"It's time to come home to Mummy. To me."

And she slung the creature - which hopefully it's obvious by now is a human-headed monkey - over her shoulder and walked out of this part of the story with him...

And back to the zoo...

## Extra Bit

Lucy Handbaghead was at the zoo.

Linda - her mum - was there too.

And they were watching a monkey, er...

Wank his big willy silly.

"Well, he looks happy, doesn't he?" said Linda to Lucy, while she balanced on her elbow in the Thirsty Pecan Pie yoga pose.

"Yes, a little too happy. I'm thankful for this plastic screen between us and him," said Lucy tapping a plastic screen, likely the one she'd just referenced.

"I'm happy for this ham sandwich," said Linda, tucking into a ham sandwich, likely the one she'd just referenced.

They both watched the monkey furiously beat his not-so-small reason.

He did look happy.

"So, have we learnt anything from our little binary escapade with a bunch of so-called manly men today, Mum?" asked Lucy.

"Er... human-headed hamsters are really good at yoga?" guessed Linda, hating any kind of quiz.

She thought a bit - the effort to do so involving sticking her tongue out and screwing up her face - then added...

"And I can knock out pretty much anyone in The Pretty Big Handbag with just one punch."

She flexed her big old biceps.

"Sure," said Lucy, "that'll do."

They continued to watch the human-headed monkey go for it until he reached the destination he was going for, if you know what I mean...

Then they walked out of the zoo...

And into another story...

## notes / to do

Ameribag / Bagmerica

Facebag / Bagbook (can't remember from other stories)

Gives monkey jordan a nice big willy to masturbate in the human-headed monkey enclosure?

Story comes full circle with last bit being Linda and Lucy watching him - or an anonymous monkey - beat one off furiously.

Lovely.

Mother nature turns up with a bunch of Them Lot Who Some People Find It Difficult To Name.

Maybe just do a transgender / harry potter spin off story - Them Lot Who Some People Find It Difficult To Name! Be pretty funny, maybe

I forgot to mention...

He's the 'Kicking Balls' champ.

NoFiddle (fap) agreement.

Something about transgender and binary stuff (for yourself if anything)

They / them / them lot
It's too hard to remember someone's new name... unless, you know, they're getting hitched under the mighty bright light of The Big Yo.

"Don't bring me into this you little skinny bag of bones," came a tipsy voice from up high.
