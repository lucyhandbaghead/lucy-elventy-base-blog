Turn your philosophy ideas into stories and characters
- The Witch of 'Negative Possibility' / some kind of guru thing
- 'System's Vomit' - Pretty Big Handbag is sick with capitalism or something (can have a personified capitalism character(s) - Charlie Coinface, Barry Billhead, Franky Fiverfeatures)
- 'Unselective Selectivity' - a bunch of authoritarian biology dweebs trying to tell Mother Nature what she can and can't do
- Write and 'Extro-Science Fiction' tale - complete chaos, so chaotic, even Chaos herself can't cope with it
- After Finitude-style story where we're setting The Pretty Big Handbag free from the leery gaze of its population
Re-write The Really Bad Smell?
- Lucy Handbaghead [FOR KIDS!] stories (With Florence and Lowen in mind)
- Maybe just do a transgender / harry potter spin off story, Them Lot Who Some People Find It Difficult To Name! Be pretty funny, maybe... they / them / them lot... It's too hard to remember someone's new name... unless, you know, they're getting hitched under the mighty bright light of The Big Yo.
