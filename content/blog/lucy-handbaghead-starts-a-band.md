[I think the word doc is slightly more up to date? Check edited dates]

Once upon a time in The Pretty Big Handbag…

Lucy Handbaghead decided to start a band.

After all, she was always singing in the shower - and the pigeons on her windowsill loved bopping along…

So, she was pretty sure she could get a stadium full of other bag- and other odd-object heads bopping along too!

That meant fame…

Money…

And Instabag followers…

And, well, more fame and money and Instabag followers!

So, she set out to find some band members.

She’d need a guitarist…

A pianist…

A harpist…

A tambourinist…

A fiddlist…

A spoon-tapperist…

And a drummerist.

It was going to be a classical, rocking, jigging, hip-hopping kind of a band…

Maybe with a little spoon tapping and fork fiddling thrown in.

And, little did she know, but without leaving her house - which is where she was making this big-band plan - she’d already found her first band member…

## Part 2: Lucy Handbaghead starts a band

As if reading Lucy’s mind, Lucy’s Mum - Linda Handbaghead - popped out of nowhere.

Okay, not nowhere, but a nearby laundry basket.

She had a bandana - fashioned from a (hopefully) clean pair of pants - wrapped around her handbaghead and was holding a wooden spoon in each hand.

“I heard you’re looking for a drummerist, Lucy?” she said.

Lucy looked at her Mum.

“Mum, how did you hear that? I was just thinking it!”

“I read the first part of this story,” said Linda. Then she added, “And don’t call me Mum, call me Dave The Even More Dangerous Drummerist. You know after Dave The Dangerous Drummerist.”

Lucy knew her Mum - and Dave The Dangerous Drummerist - all too well, so she didn’t try to fight her on this.

She just nodded her head…

And, just like that, she had the first member of her band.

Now, to find those other band mates…

## Part 3: Lucy Handbaghead starts a band

Lucy didn’t know any musical people - including her Mum, who she’d just hired as the drummerist in her new band…

So, she went to a place where she was guaranteed to find musical people…

A gig.

But not just any gig…

At her Mum’s arm-twisting request, they went to see Linda’s favourite band…

The Hard Of Hearing Leopards.

But none of the band members - who were all leopards - could hear her shouting at them over their own way too loud songs.

So - while Linda had got all the band members to sign her leopard-print handbaghead and kiss her in places too naughty for this story - Lucy checked her phone for more gigs.

And Lucky for Lucy - and this story’s plot progression - she saw there was a very special gig about to happen…

A ‘Giga Gig’.

All the most famous - and richest - pop stars of The Pretty Big Handbag were playing together to raise money to help all the rubbish musicians out there…

It was called ‘Bad Bands Aid’.

Lucy pulled her saliva-covered Mum out of the bundle of leopards and dragged her towards the ‘Giga Gig’…

And the next part of this story…

[193]

## Part 4: Lucy Handbaghead starts a band

A poster outside the ‘Bad Bands Aid’ listed the gig’s lineup.

There was…

Justin Babybumface, whose lyrics you couldn’t hear because he always wore a nappy over his extremely smooth bum face.

Adele The Cockney Sausage who loved nothing more than to stick her sausagehead in a floury bap covered in brown sauce.

Lady Loopy Lala Pants who always wore a dress made out of spaghetti bolognaise.

And a few others, who we might meet in a moment.

Kanye Compasshead - whose face was stuck always facing a Westerly direction - wouldn’t be there…

Apparently, he’d been dropped for littering in a public place, or inciting genocide, or something like that.

All in all, Lucy was pretty unexcited for the gig.

And Linda was busy squeezing leopard-saliva out of her hair and into a small container - presumably to sell, drink or add to her shrine later.

However, they still went in.

And we followed…

[152]

## Part 5: Lucy Handbaghead starts a band

The ‘Bad Bands Aid’ was popping.

Well, for the rich lot on the stage, anyway.

The crowd was full of poor, unsuccessful musicians, caps - or capheads - in hand, collectively wailing a cat-screeching rendition of Wonderful Wall, by the Ballbaghead Brothers.

“You all suck,” a man on the stage shouted through a megaphone and into the wailing crowd.

He had a bobble hat for a head and was scruffy in a way that had taken a mirror and several hours of applying fluff to perfect.

“And that’s why I - Bobblehathead Geldolfini - have gathered all these rich, successful, good-looking musicians to come and shower you in pity and autotune.”

He pointed at the rabble of manufactured beauty behind him.

There was the previously mentioned lot, plus Niki Bagminge - the original toosh tantruming twerk-star - who'd had an extra bum grafted onto her bum, and then another bum onto that one too.

The rich rabble on stage started singing a song they’d clearly prepared for the event.

It went, “Feed the Wooooordllleee!”

And they were playing on their phones while they sang it.

“What is this?” said Lucy. “They’re just taking the piss out of these poor, crap musicians.”

“Get off me,” said Linda, kicking a handsy Chris Martinihead lookalike into a passing Tom Yorkshirepuddinghead lookalike.

“Come on, Mum. We’re going to stop this,” said Lucy.

And she dragged Linda up onto the stage…

[230]

## Part 6: Lucy Handbaghead starts a band

“Wanker?” sang Lady Loopy Lala Pants.

“Sausage?” suggested Adele Sausagehead.

“Xylophone?” rapped Niki Bagminge.

“I already told you, Niki, there’s no blummin’ X in it!,” bellowed Adele Saugsagehead.

“Hoomph!” wailed Justin Babybumface.

The others thought he was suggesting a word, but actually he’d just been drop kicked in his baby-bum face by Linda Handbaghead.

His baby-bum face detached from his withering body in a fountain of blood and inside bits and rolled across the stage.

The famous bunch stopped singing their Wooooordllleee guesses and began to scream…

Then a fight broke out.

And the crowd - finally - began to cheer…

[99]

## Part 7: Lucy Handbaghead starts a band

The fight went down like this…

Linda Handbaghead dished out some of her famous leopard-print-covered headbutts.

Lucy threw a few one-twos, then some three-fours, and a maverick forty-nine.

Lady Loopy Lala Pants whirled some spaghetti nunchucks - which she’d made out of her dress -  at Lucy and Linda unpredictably.

Adele Sausagehead used her sausage head like a ketchup-covered baseball bat, trying to knock them out of the venue - which I should have mentioned by now was a handbag-shaped stadium made out of crystal called Crystal Handbag.

Niki Bagminge tried to sandwich them both in between her clapping bum cheeks - an experience some in the crowd would have paid good money for.

And Bobblehathead Geldolfini flung deadly razor-edged peace signs at them like frisbees.

Heads were hacked.

Limbs lopped.

And bodies bruised.

And - when the smoke and glitter finally cleared - only two were left standing.

Lucy and Linda, of course!

And they began to sing…

A proper song…

Not about Wooooordllleee…

[152]

## Part 8: Lucy Handbaghead starts a band

“We’re The Handbag Bandheads, and we’re going to blow your mother-floppy socks off - both of them!” bellowed Lucy.

The crowd of crap musicians roared with glee, some already throwing their socks at the stage in adulation.

Linda started banging her drums.

Lucy began wailing.

No, wait… that’s singing - an attempt at it anyway.

So, Lucy began to… sing!

And then… a voice bellowed from up above them all…

The Big Yo - the almighty yo-yo-headed deity in charge of The Pretty Big Handbag - shouted down from his up-high bachelor pad, The Big Yo-Yo In The Sky, “Can you keep it down, down there you two? I’ve got a banging headache!”

“Well, you shouldn’t have gone out on a bender last night with The Grim Bagger, should you? Suck it up yo-yo, boy!” belted Linda.

She made the sacred swirly yo-yo sign - just in case The Big Yo was really angry and considering retaliation - and then began to bash her drums even louder…

Actually, she ABSOLUTELY SMASHED THEM TO MUSICAL-SMITHEREENS!

In unison, Lucy strummed the bloody guitar she’d nicked off one of the deceased…

And strummed her vocal chords, which she’d got off her mother via genetics or something…

And - for the second time in this story - they performed their first ever song.

This time, without interruption…

It went like this…

[202]

## Part 9: Lucy Handbaghead starts a band

“Like a virgin, fingered for the very first time…’ Linda started belting out in a vaguely sing-song voice trained on a thousand cigarettes.

“Hold on!” Shouted Lucy, putting her hand up, the universal
Sign for ‘Mum, you’re definitely not a virgin’ - and breaking the narrator’s previous promise of no more interruptions.

“Mum, no one’s buying that - let’s do our family anthem, the ‘Handbaghead Boogie’.”

“Alright,” Linda grinned, and started beating her boobs on her drum kit, because everyone knows boobs are better drum sticks than drum sticks, not quite as good as chicken drumsticks, mind, but Linda didn’t have any of those to hand.

Lucy began to sing…

“Lucy and Linda…

“We’re the Handbaghead mother and daughter, er, sisters…

“Obviously not biological sisters, that would be weird!

“Speaking of weird, my mum can grow a diabolical beard!

She just, like, shaves it off every day with garden shears…”

Linda chimed in - well, more bellowed in…

“I do not, you little scally-wag!

“I should thump you…

“Jump you…

“Use my handbaghead to bump you…

“But I won’t because your head is the best shape, the shape of a handbag!”

Together they sang…

“Handbag heads rule…

“We’re better than carrier bag heads…

“Rubbish bin heads…

“Briefcase heads…

“Testube heads…

“And all the other bag and odd-object shaped heads!

“This is the handbaghead boogie and you’re all well jel!

“Look at my pony tail as I swirl it around… it twirls!”

“So, do my boobs,” added Linda, backing up her statement with a demonstration in case anyone doubted her.

They proceeded to mash their instruments - Lucy on the guitar, Linda on the boob drums - to musical smithereens.

[274]

## Part 10: Lucy Handbaghead starts a band

The crowd head banged.

The crowd hopped.

The crowd jumped.

The crowd backflipped.

The crowd belly flopped.

And The Big Yo shouted down from up high, “Boogie on you non-biological sisters! Yeeeeehaaaawwwwwww!”

He might have been over the limit for driving his roofless hover car through the clouds, but definitely not for yelling praise (or obscenities) down at the population of The Pretty Big Handbag.

Not being ones for the traditional structure of music - or anything…

‘The Handbag Bagheads’ skipped verses, choruses, and basic rhyming patterns and flew into the climatic tail end of their song, singing…

“We love to boogie…

“We love to boogie…

“Handbaghead boogie…

“Handbagheads are the best for boogie…

“We love to boogie…

“We love to handbaghead boogie on a Tuesday night!”

And then all of a sudden, Linda abruptly stopped wacking her boobs on her drums and shouted…

“BUGGER! It’s Wednesday tomorrow isn’t it? I’ve got an appointment with my podiatrist in the morning… he’s taking a chainsaw to my bunions! And I fancy the foot-fingering pants off of him, so I need my beauty sleep.”

And with that she ran off the stage, presumably in a direct bee line for her bed.

Lucy bowed to the stunned crowd and followed in her mother’s in-need-of-chainsaw attention footsteps.

On her way out of the venue - Crystal Handbag - she heard the crowd erupt into apoplectic applause…

They were so bloody happy about the performance they were angry it had to come to an end.

But, like all good and bad - and everything in between - things, it did.

Like this story…

So, the blummin’ end.

[267]

## Extra bit: Lucy Handbaghead starts a band

Oh yeah, before I go, two things…

First, The crowd clapped with so much smiling rage that the crystal stadium cracked, then shattered, then fell on their heads.

And, second - and as a direct consequence of the first thing -  this gig became part of ‘The Handbag Bandheads’ mysterious mythos, namely because it would be their first and only ever gig…

But also because most of the crowd had been crushed and lacerated to death by giant shards of falling crystal.

People would pay BIG MONEY (in capitals) for bootleg recordings of it in the future, let me tell you.

Anyway, this is the real blummin’ end.
