## Part 1

Once upon a time in The Pretty Big Handbag...

Lucy Handbaghead was at the zoo.

Linda - her mum - was there too.

And they were watching a monkey do a poo.

I'm not sure what kind of worlds you're familiar with, but monkeys - and animals in general - in The Pretty Big Handbag are maybe a little bit different to what you're used to...

You see, they don't have bags for heads...

Or odd-objects for heads...

Or even 'animal' heads, like you might find elsewhere out there amongst the stars (or down the back of the cosmic sofa)...

Instead, they all have fleshy human heads.

Like no fur, except sometimes a bit on top...

And they're capable of all kinds of horrific expressions, like smiling, frowning, and - in the case of the monkey in question - straining really hard.

It was all a bit weird to be honest.

Especially if you were used to being able to keep your purse in your head, like Lucy and Linda.

Lucky for those two beauts though - as in Lucy and Linda - they were completely oblivious to the potential for monkeys - and other animals - to have different kinds of heads... 

And were just busy happily watching the human-headed, furry-bodied monkey squeeze out a big fat curly one.

Well, they were anyway until their attention was yanked elsewhere by a sentence that parachuted in on the wind like a bad-smelling monkey-poo...

"And that is why women - especially handbag headed women - will always be inferior to the more powerful of our species... the man, especially those wearing the illustrious pita-bread hat."

A round of bad-smelling applause followed, sky-diving in on the next puff of wind.

Lucy and Linda looked at each other.

A look that said one thing...

And that thing was, 'We'll bloody see about that.'

They turned their back on the pooping monkey - much to his dismay because he was rather enjoying their attention - and marched off in the direction the words had come from...

Which was off that way, up there...

Yes, behind those bins...

## Part 2

The human-headed hamster enclosure had never been so packed...

And not with human-headed hamsters - although there were a few of them doing yoga and eating ham sandwiches...

But with absolute dweebs.

It was a serious sea of unwashed pants...

Involuntarily ejaculation...

And the inability to talk to anyone with a pair of boobs that wasn't their mum or a poster of their mum.

Oh, and they were all wearing pita bread hats on their unanimously greasy heads...

Which basically just means they have pita breads on their heads.

The crowd was, of course, all men...

And on a scale of Alpha to Beta and all the way down to Omega - AKA the The Alphabet Of Bicep-Pumping Testosterone - they had all fallen off the end and were scrabbling around to create a new even-manlier alphabet...

One where women - and anyone else who didn't identify as a big manly man - weren't invited.

At the front of the room - standing on a hamster cage and gesturing with his hands like he was parting a great red sea, but in fact was parting a great sweaty sea - was a very thin man with a real pita bread for a head...

And he was mid speech - declaration even - saying...

"Nature has spoken. The natural order is fixed. It's not sexist - nor political - to say that men have found themselves at the apex, the crux, the summit of bag and other odd object head kind... we are the rugged shepherds - the brave human-headed dog walkers - of all who inhabit The Pretty Big Handbag, tasked with guiding our great civilisation to ever greater, ever more productive, ever more manly heights... and making sure womankind - and Them Lot Who Shan't Be Named - don't get too emotional and bring all we have worked so hard - and grown immaculate beards - for tumbling down."

The dweeb sea erupted into clammy applause and undiluted sweat that tasted of insecurity and 24-hour non-stop video game marathons sprayed everywhere.

I know it tasted like that for sure because a bit landed in my mouth.

Anyway, Lucy and Linda had been standing at the back of the hamster enclosure listening to all of this dressed-up diatribe...

And they could no longer keep quiet...

# Part 3

"Oi pita bread head, what the hell are you on about?" shouted Lucy.

The sea of dweebs gasped.

Two women - and the worst kind at that, filthy, filthy handbag heads - had come within touching distance of their big fat wobbly man boobs.

And they - as in the sea of dweebs - were all instantly erect.

But - despite all their blood rapidly rushing out of their arms and towards their not-so-ample nether regions - most of them still managed to whip out their phones.

After all, this could be another viral moment...

A clip of their pita-headed overlord owning some more 'boobed noobs' with his ferocious intellect and masterfully angular eyebrows...

And any one of these dweebs - yes even Nathan Neckbeard over there, four rows from the front, who had a bearded neck for a head - could be the lucky pita bread hat wearer who uploaded the clip to BagTube or BagTok or Instabag and got all the views.

The pita bread headed man focused all of his watery-eyed attention on Lucy and Linda...

Put his fingers together in an arched temple - presumably an act of prayer or - more than likely - self worship...

And then launched this intellectual - or at least intelligible - attack on the two handbag-headed women...

"My name is Jordan Pitabreadhead," he bellowed in a voice doing its best to sound post-pubescent, "and I have been sent here on a very important mission to fix The Crisis In Tiny Willies."

There was a slightly muted applause from the crowd - minus Lucy and Linda and the hamsters - as legs were crossed and heads were shook in a 'he's not talking about me and my big dong' gesture.

"You've been sent to this zoo to do what now?" asked Linda raising an eyebrow and partaking in a bit of yoga with the hamsters.

"It sounds like you're having a crisis in something alright," said Lucy, tucking into a sandwich handed to her by one of the hamsters...

Who admirably seemed to be doing their best just to ignore what was going on in their enclosure.

"A crisis in self esteem, self awareness and the ability to do push ups by the look of it!" said Linda, bending over into a sideways penguin pose.

"There you go!" erupted Jordan Pittabreadhead, spitting angry cucumber and guacamole bits over the crowd.

"These women are EMOTIONAL! They're letting their emotions override their logical brain bits... in fact, research suggests - no ORDERS - that handbag heads like these two have no logical brain bits whatsoever! So, no wonder they're overflowing with dribbling, mindless, blinding, sexy - no, dammit, not sexy - very-not-sexy, self-deluding EMOTION!"

The crowd turned their phones - all lit with little red recording light glows - from their super-manly master to Lucy and Linda...

And proceeded to recorded events that what would later be used as evidence in various police stations, (what counts for legal in The Pretty Big Handbag) courts...

Broadcast across major news channels - like Fuck You News and The Pretty Big Handbag Broadcasting Company...

And even make an appearance in The Bathroom Of Final Judgement in The Big Yo's Mighty Decision Making Mansion...

## Part 4

"I feel like we should belt him one for that Mum," said Lucy, "but I can't really be... bothered."

"I mean, I'm actually not all that bothered either," said Linda, "he seems to be doing a good enough job of making a tit out of himself without our help."

Some nearby dweeb erections throbbed sinfully at the mention of 'tit'.

"Yer, if he carries on like that he's going to overcook his own pita bread head," said Lucy.

So - perhaps for the first time in a Lucy Handbaghead story - a fight seemed like it *wasn't* going to break out.

But then... what the hell would this story be about?

So, that's when - as if by plot progressing magic - a bloke with a very shiny potato for a head kicked his way through the wall of the human-headed hamster enclosure...

Which was made out of straw and shedded hamster fur, so it wasn't all that an impressive feat after all.

But that didn't stop him from flexing his potato pecks and baked-potato biceps - in fact, all his mash-potato muscles - in a self-congratulatory display of strength that

He was wearing a jacket made out of foreskins, had a martial arts belt tied around his potato head, and was carrying a bunch of leaflets...

Which he immediately began to chuck out into the sea of dweebs, who snapped them up with the eagerness of 




Follow me!
