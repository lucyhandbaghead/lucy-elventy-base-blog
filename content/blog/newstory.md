## Part 1

Once upon a time in The Pretty Big Handbag...

Lucy Handbaghead was feeling lonely.

So, she got herself on some dating websites.

Then she got off them because dating websites - like all websites on The Pretty Big Handbag Wide Web - are too fragile to sit on...

You know, because they're made of human-headed spider webs.

Anyway, she downloaded the dating apps onto her phone because you can sit on phones as much as you like...

A fact Lucy's mum, Linda, regularly demonstrated by accidentally (but kind of on purpose) parking her industrial-sized behind on Lucy's phone - and any other phone in the area of designated derri√®re destruction.

The apps Lucy downloaded were...

Minger...

Big Bumble...

Willy Grinder...

Plenty Of Penis...

OK Stupid (Get Off Me)...

Too Good For You Singles...

eHarmonica (a niche site for people who like putting harmonicas in tight, damp spaces)...

And Fanny Flap...

An app for classy hipsters to meet up on and sleep in expensive tents and compare moustache swirls.

Lucy spent a long time writing her dating profile...

At least 30 seconds.

It read...

"I like paddle boarding. Don't apply if you're not taller than a hamster standing up really tall." 

Linda, "Core blimey, Luce, look at that something-head. Can I get in on this too? I like paddble-boarding!"

"Mum, you've never been paddle boarding in your life," said Lucy, but she didn't bother to argue about her tagging along as she knew she'd come along whatever she said.

And, anyway, if one of these dates turned out to be a dud her Mum's massive biceps could come in handy...

But fights never break out in Lucy Handbaghead stories, so I doubt that'd be necessary...

## Part 2

Something

## notes

goes on a bunch of dates with men, women, in-betweens, out-betweens and hamsters

Linda goes on them all with her? most likely
