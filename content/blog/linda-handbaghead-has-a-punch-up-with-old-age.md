## Part 1

Once upon a time in The Pretty Big Handbag...

Specifically, in Linda Handbaghead's boudoir...

Which, if you don't know, is a private room for women to do private stuff in, like watch the TV gossip show Loose Bagheads in peace...

Eat their freshly cut toenails...

And - in Linda's case - do pelvic hip thruster exercises with large pieces of iron (and the occasional - from her perspective - lucky visitor)...

Linda Handbaghead was driving a bulldozer full of makeup over her industrial-sized leopard-print handbag face.

She backed it up for another go around...

And then another...

And one more for good luck...

And, then, there we go, perfect...

She was ready to go out.

As if to confirm this, she shouted downstairs, "I'm ready to go out!"

"It's about blummin' time," came a voice from downstairs...

A voice that was so full of loving impatience - minus some of the loving - towards Linda it could only belong to one person...

Or one handbaghead...

That being Lucy Handbaghead.

"Let's go to the pub already, Mum," shouted Lucy.

And - a bit unusually, as she wasn't normally one to comply to the demands of others - Linda rode out of her boudoir on her makeup bulldozer and down the stairs.

Lucy hopped in and off they went to the pub, leaving a river of colourful makeup in their beautiful wake...

## Part 2

Just like Linda didn't usually comply unquestioningly to other people's requests...

She also didn't usually give a damn what they - they being just about anybody in The Pretty Big Handbag - thought of her.

Whether it was the fact she talked at a volume about three megaphones higher than everyone else...

Or that she liked to drink her pints while standing on top of tables or on other bag or odd-object heads...

Or that the handbaghead-shaped tattoo on her right bicep read 'Everybody Sucks Except Me And Lucy, Init!'...

Or - important for our current tale - whether her leopard-print handbag head looked like it could do with going through a few cycles in the washing machine, or not.

Linda had been like this for all of her life...

Ever since she came flying out of her mother's - Glenda Handbaghead's - womb demanding a strong pint of ale and for the toughest guy in the hospital to be brought to her immediately, so she could arm wrestle him.

That's why she found it so confusing when she walked into the pub and she felt a really weird, un-Linda-ry feeling...

Like everyone was looking at her...

And, instead of liking that and flexing her massive biceps - as she usually might do - she felt...

A prickly feeling creeping up her spine that made her want to turn and run away...

Or curl up into a ball and roll into the nearest human-sized hole (which was the hidden tunnel down one of the pub's loos that led down to The Underbag - so that wouldn't be good!)...

What was this feeling?

It couldn't be... self consciousness, could it?

And then Linda noticed somebody sitting - rather smugly - in the corner...

And the creeping feeling of self-consciousness enveloping her body and handbag head morphed into one of absolute horror...

## Part 3

There are cute wrinkles...

Like crows feet on the sides of a pair of aging eyes...

Or a wrinkly little dog who looks more like an accordion than a pet...

Or the folds of a generously perky bum - no, we're not talking about Lucy's or Linda's because we don't want a thump...

And then there are not-so-cute, even horror-inducing wrinkles...

Like the greasy folds of a bloated, wriggling maggot...

Or the skin-like wrinkles forming the dark brown, gelatin film of / stretching across three-day old gravy...

Or the curling folds of a steaming hot ice-cream shaped dog poo baking on a mid-summer pavement...

Or the flapping fleshy waves of The Sea Of Flappy Flaps, found in The Underbag - which might feature later on in this story...

Old Age - for that was who was downing a pint of bitter in the corner of the pub and staring at Linda Handbaghead - was made up from the latter kind of wrinkles...

The not-so-cute, even horror-inducing kind.

And she... he... them... it... was not just made up from wrinkly nightmares...

But every horrifying aspect of the ageing process, all rolled up into one putrid, decaying body...

We're talking zombified patches of dead flesh clinging to batches of bloated body...

Clumps of wire-like hair needled into a savage skull pushing itself through translucent skin, like undead jelly...

All hanging off the rest of the skeletal frame heaving uneasily under the weight and decay of hard years.

Flies circled...

A visible stench curled off of it...

In short, Old Age was an unedible buffet of stinking, skeletal sag.

"Linda Handbaghead, it's time," it said, wheezing flies and knocking out a few pub patrons with the strength of its awesome breath, "You're scheduled to start The Really Mean, Applause!"

Out of nowhere - or perhaps the unseen depths of The Pretty Big Handbag - sounded a round of - apparently un-embodied - clapping.

For a moment Linda was frozen to the spot...

All eyes in the pub seemed to *still* be on her...

*All... eyes... on... me...* she thought.

*Wait, I know what to do*...

And then Linda did something very Linda-ry...

She rolled up her sleeves and marched towards Old Age...

## Part 4

Linda punched Old Age square in her wrinkly, skeletal maggot face...

And Old Age's skull shattered into many - at least three - jagged pieces, to float around in her see-through jelly dome like shrapnel in frog spawn.

"Well, that was easy," said Linda, turning towards the bar to order a pint of her favourite ale, Big Bicep Bevvy.

And then something hit her in the side of her handbag head like a steam train...

Or more like a clammy, sweat train.

After Linda picked herself off the floor, dusted herself off, and pushed her handbaghead back on straight, she saw it was Old Age's wet pensioner fist that had belted her a good one.

So, it was back on...

They - Linda and Old Age - faced each other like cowboy hat heads at dawn - well, more like a handbag head and a monstrosity at mid-afternoon, because that's what time it was...

But they were both now wearing cowboy hats, pulled from who knows where.

For a moment the whole pub was silent...

Every patron hanging on really tentery tenterhooks...

Not because of the imminent eruption of violence between a well-known handbag-headed patron and the embodied manifestation of getting on a bit...

But because someone had just turned the TV off which was showing the Bagball Championships.

Lucy switched it back on.

And - as if on queue - Linda and Old Age started blasting...

They finger blasted each other rampantly...

As in pretended to shoot each other with their fingers.

They fisted each other enthusiastically...

As in punched each other with their densely closed fists.

And they gave each other plenty of head too...

As in headbutts, head-bangs, head-wallops and every head-based attack in between.

Anyway, that's all to say they had a right royal, down and dirty, proper punch up...

They rolled around the pub in a swirling cloud of sweat, smoke and old skin debris...

Knocking over chairs, tables, shouting patrons, and barrels of ale as they went...

Until they rolled - still punching and headbutting - into the loos and - after a couple of head noogies and arm twists - wrestled each other down one of the loos...

Which just happened to be the one that - as I mentioned earlier - led down to The Underbag...

## Part 5

The Underbag isn't the most welcoming of places at the best of times...

The best of times being Everlasting Bagfire Night, when naughty underbag-lings get roasted in even naughtier oven heads...

Or Plague-cake Tuesdays, when all the deceased frying pan heads cook poison-laced, honey-topped cakes for brekkie...

Or - still on the deadly baking theme - Bake The Wake Off - and the celebrity version - where de-stitched bag heads get rolled up into pastry and made into a variety of baked goods...

But it - as in The Underbag - was *especially* unwelcoming during the daily rush hour.

That is the hour that came once a day where The Underlord Of The Underbag, The Grim Bagger, AKA The Patchwork Prince himself, AKA Grimmy B, gave all of the deceased, de-stitched denizens of The Underbag the opportunity to be re-stitched and (kind of) reborn...

He called it the 'Re-in-kami-car-zi-nation' race.

It was a blood-thirsty, violent race around the mean streets, and death-trap highways of The Underbag, in all kinds of fiery, fleshy and otherwise gruesome vehicles and vehicle-esque contraptions...

And whoever won the race got to pick a new bag or other odd-object head to be stitched - or grafted - onto their also recently repaired body, so they could go back upstairs into the roomy living space of The Pretty Big Handbag, to live what passes as a normal life up there.

Anyway, it was during the final stages of this race - around a particularly sharp corner, as in sharp with deathly, blood-soaked spikes - when Linda and Old Age came tumbling out of the sky...

Still punching and headbutting each other a goodun.

And they landed directly on the bonnet of the vehicle leading the 'Re-in-kami-car-zi-nation' race...

A garden lawn mower fashioned into a monster truck with some barbed wire, extra wheels and sticky-back plastic.

It was being driven - rather recklessly - by the former Mob Boss of The Pretty Big Handbag's Muva Mafia, Big Han The Hairy Head Cutter...

Who - needless to say, but I will anyway - wasn't very happy about her new, uninvited, passengers...

## Part 6

Big Han The Hairy Head Cutter had an air-powered oven for a head, so she could cook meals for her hundreds of children in record time, plus roast anyone who wouldn't pay up to the Muva Mafia racket...

She also had a criminal record as long as Linda Handbaghead's makeup shopping list, on which were BIG CRIMES (in capitals) that even made The Grim Bagger wince.

She'd whacked rival mafia bosses and unsuspecting moles poking their heads out of holes - decapitating both indiscriminately, which is where she got her name from...

She'd robbed high-security milk factories and the occasional bank (mainly for the free pens they have tied down at the counters)...

And she'd smuggled illegal goods from The Far Side Of The Pretty Big Handbag to The Near Side...

Like exotic talking pigeons, Big Time Party Bum Cakes, and a guy with a bucket of diamonds for a head, called Dave Diamondbuckethead, or just Diamond Dave to his mates.

In short, she was a right rotter.

So, it should come as no surprise to find out she'd gone to school with - and once upon a time was good mates with - Linda Handbaghead...

Who still owed her a tenner and half a sausage roll.

"Oi, Linda," roared Big Han The Hairy Head Cutter, "You still owe me a tenner and half a sausage roll!"

Linda looked up from stamping on Old Age's really wrinkly bum...

"Big Han! It's good to see you babes," she said before receiving one of Old Age's wrinkly feet to her well-makeup-ed face.

But Big Han just ignored her and - in a rage of misplaced sausage-roll fury - kicked through the windshield of her lawnmower turned monster truck and jumped onto the bonnet with her dual milk guns - which isn't a euphuism - blasting at full milky blast...

## Part 7

Now, I'm not sure if you've ever seen a high-speed lawnmower turned monster truck bonnet fight before...

But there's only really one rule: whoever falls - or is belted - off the bonnet first loses.

And by loses I mean falls down into the deep, dark, unknowable depths of The Very Bottom Of The Pretty Big Handbag, which is a layer even lower down in The Pretty Big Handbag hierarchy than The Underbag, where The Grim Bagger and - alarmingly - even The Big Yo have no jurisdiction (or mates).

So, it's an all round pretty bad place to fall into.

With that in mind, faced with a bigger problem than each other - namely Big Han - Linda Handbaghead and Old Age had stopped punching the living pigeons out of each other and were dodging the milky bullets being fired in their direction like two absolute milk-dodging pros. 

They were also wearing trench coats and sunglasses and moving in slow motion and the camera - as in your viewpoint of this story - was spinning around them in a cool 360 degree arch...

Because, you know, why not?

But that didn't last for long...

Old Age was caught in the thigh by a milky milk bullet and collapsed into a fleshy heap on the bonnet.

And Linda caught a ricocheting milky milk bullet on the side of her leopard-print handbag head and flipped dramatically in the air before bouncing off the bonnet and down into...

Oh, wait, no... phew!

She Just managed to cling onto a headlight with her not-so-well manicured claws.

The lawnmower turned monster truck hurtled across a razor-sharp roundabout which sliced and diced a few of the following vehicles.

Meanwhile on the bonnet Big Han power-waddled towards Linda, who was putting in a lot of bicep effort to maintain her precarious position...

Big Han cocked her milky milk guns - which is still not a euphemism...

Big Han said, "Linda, no one - not even old school mates like you - can do me out of a sausage roll. I'm sorry... but I've got to do this..."

Big Han lined Linda up in her milky milk gun sites...

And then Big Han pulled the milky trigger...

Or, she tried to, but out of nowhere - or probably somewhere, because things usually come from somewhere - a wet pensioner fist belted Big Han across her air-powered oven face...

And she fell like a hefty sack of potatoes - or a weighty packet of peanuts - off the bonnet of the lawnmower turned monster truck and hurtled down towards The Very Bottom Of The Pretty Big Handbag and whatever unknowable horrors lurked down there...

## Part 8

And that - as in the last few bits of this story which involved a lot of punching and a lot of milk - was how Old Age and Linda came to win the 'Re-in-kami-car-zi-nation' race...

And, ultimately, became pretty good mates.

As I mentioned earlier, the winner of this daily rush hour race would usually be rewarded with a new noggin and a boot up the bum sending them flying back up to the living bits of The Pretty Big Handbag...

But - despite being a bit haggard - Linda was still alive...

So, instead of offering her the standard restitching treatment, The Grim Bagger gave Linda two tickets to The Underbag's most popular holiday destination, The Sea of Flappy Flaps.

And Lucy - who despite being absent for most of this story but was fringes - suggested her Mum take Old Age with her.
//
After some bumbling and mumbling about being forever young, Linda agreed and she and Old Age spent a couple of weeks chilling out by The Sea Of Flappy Flaps.

They surfed the fleshy, flappy waves on body boards, as in a few stiff old women Old Age had rounded up...

They swigged Pornstar Fleshtinis, Flapgaritas and other flesh-based cocktails...

And in the evenings (and early mornings) they hit up the bars...

Where they belted out old classics on the karaoke machines - like 'I Kissed A Sausage And I Liked It' and 'Come On Irene, Hurry The Flip Up, We're Late Again'...

And tried - and, in Linda's case succeeded - to pull big burly flesh surfers, like the famous Barry Boogieboardhead.

And, after spending this good quality, fleshy time together...

Linda came to the decision that Old Age wasn't that bad after all!

In fact, there were some pretty nice benefits to accepting the wrinkly youth abyss that was Old Age as part of her life, such as...

Having afternoon naps in the tumble dryer...

Pretending you couldn't hear stuff you didn't feel like hearing, like people's thoughts on whether The Big Yo was just a front man for the shadowy group of hamsters who were really running The Pretty Big Handbag...

Being described as a big cat - in, Linda's case a leopard-print one to match her handbag head - if you had a habit for nibbling on the fleshy bits of younger bag and other odd object heads...

And - probably most magically - appreciating your family that little bit more because of the increasingly obvious fact of your own - and their - immortality.

So, Linda left her holiday at The Sea Of Flappy Flaps with a box full of fleshy cocktails and a new feeling in her tummy...

One that told her she was getting on a bit, but everything was going to be okay...

In fact, it was going to be blummin' great...

And she was going to manifest that feeling into the world by doing something she didn't usually do...

## Part 9

Linda walked into her and Lucy's handbag-shaped house and said...

"Lucy, you little scrub, come over here."

Lucy did as her mother commanded, not because she was prone to doing what her mum or anyone else wanted - at least not without a bit of back and forth - but because she saw something in her mother's eyes that wasn't usually in there...

Something soft...

Something in need...

Even something vulnerable.

And this was confirmed when Linda Handbaghead spread her massive bicep-bulging wingspan and then wrapped her armageddon arms around her daughter...

And they stood there, in the living room of their little home - because that's where they were - embraced like two handbag heads who loved each other very much.

It would be wrong to say Linda didn't show Lucy love and protection...

She did, in absolute bucket loads, but in her own way, which usually involved fighting on behalf of her daughter, or at least threatening violence on behalf of her daughter...

Or just following her daughter into one mad story after another.

So, an intimate hug like this was something special.

And something special should be left to be whatever it wants to be, even if that's just to exist for a bit longer.

So, that's where we'll leave this story...

With Lucy and Linda embraced in an eternal hug for as long as this story doesn't have another part...

Which it won't!
